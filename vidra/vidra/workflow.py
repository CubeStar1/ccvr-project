"""The whole run: extract with `video_rag`, then aggregate what it extracted.

    video_rag    a video in, a searchable index of moments out
    aggregates   higher-level answers over what video_rag extracted

This file calls the two drivers and nothing below them. `Options` is flat:
both tiers' settings in one record.

The library reads nothing by default; a run is where the choice is made. Every
aggregator up to `tier` runs on everything extraction produced: the counters
on the record, each text aggregator on the transcript and every answer's prose,
each link profile on every answer.
