Nothing is read by default. An excerpt names the transcript, the answers, or
both, and every answer names its fields; `summary` is the answer's prose. A
key of `answers` is an answer id as `descriptions.json` stores it:
`clip:activity`, or `yolo` for a sampler asked its own question. A name, a
field or an answer this record does not have is refused here, before
anything is paid for.
