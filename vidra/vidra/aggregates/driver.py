"""The aggregates driver: one verb every aggregator shares, and the pipeline.

    answer(name, data)                   -> Aggregate   the work, on objects
    aggregate(out=..., **aggregators)    -> Produced    the pipeline

What each aggregator reads:

    stats · coverage · speakers     a record      `record(timeline=..., ...)`
    ner · sentiment · prompts       an Excerpt    `record.excerpt(...)`
    entities:<profile>              Sightings     `record.sightings(...)`

The pipeline runs exactly the aggregators it is handed an input for, cheapest
first, and nothing by default:

    aggregate(out="d/aggregates", models=models, database=db,
              summary=said_and_seen, ner=said, stats=video,
              sentiment={"spoken": said, "seen": seen},
              entities_people=people,
              settings={"ner": {"labels": ["person"]}})

A dict of inputs gives one answer each, stored as `sentiment~spoken`.
`entities:people` is `entities_people` as a keyword and `entities.people.json`
on disk. `previous=` is a folder of earlier answers, reused while current.
