"""The sampler contract.

A sampler sees the decimated stream one frame at a time and answers yes or
no; it cannot look ahead or revisit a frame. The base class enforces:

    min_interval_s  smallest gap between two kept frames
    max_per_chunk   ceiling on frames kept from one chunk
    prompts         which questions describe should ask about these frames

Rate limits apply before `propose` runs, and every chunk keeps at least one
frame. Prompts are opaque strings here.

`views` says how a kept frame is shown to the model: by default the frame
itself (`View.FRAME`); a sampler may add or substitute images made from it --
crops, enlargements, a marked copy -- each stored beside the frame.
