"""The retrieve component: a query -> ranked moments. Writes nothing.

The query is embedded with the embedder that built the index; every row
carries its embedder key and only rows in that space are searched. Ranking is
the database's (`Database.search`; for Supabase the `vr_search` RPC). With a
visual embedder too, the frames' space is searched apart and the two rankings
are fused by rank, never by similarity.

    fusion, not a similarity. `database` is a built `Database`
    (`Supabase()` when None). `models.embedder` must be the one the index was
    built with; None is OpenAI's default.

    `models.visual_embedder` also searches the frames `glance` embedded, in
    their own ranking; a chunk both rankings find gets the second-account
    bonus. Given alone, only the frames are searched -- the default text
    embedder is used only when no visual embedder is named.
