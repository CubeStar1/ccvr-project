A question is an instruction and a shape; the shape holds the response
schema. A custom question names a shipped shape or brings its own, built from
`fields` (`text` or `list`, `of` for a list of objects, `one_of` for a fixed
vocabulary). A custom entry may not shadow a built-in question or shape, and
an unknown question resolves to the shape marked `fallback`.
