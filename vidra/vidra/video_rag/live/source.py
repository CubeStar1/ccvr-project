"""A live source: decoded frames, on a clock that starts at the first frame.

Anything PyAV can open is a source -- `tcp://0.0.0.0:9000?listen=1` (wait for
a sender), `udp://...`, `rtmp://...`, `rtsp://camera/...`, or a file, which is
then read as fast as it decodes.

A stream's timestamps start wherever the sender's clock was, and jump when it
reconnects or wraps. `media_ts` is counted from the first frame, a jump forward
larger than `gap_s` is recorded as a gap, and a jump backward continues the
clock where it was rather than going back in time. Wall time is recorded beside
each frame as a label (`seen_at`); no decision is made on it.
