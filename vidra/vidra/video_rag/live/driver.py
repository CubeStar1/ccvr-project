"""The live pipeline: a stream in, an answer per kept frame as it happens, and
the same documents as `offline` when the stream ends.

    video_rag_live("tcp://0.0.0.0:9000?listen=1", "data/out", video_id="dock-3",
                   sampler=Clip(prompts=["safety"]), on_unit=check)

Two threads. The sampling thread decodes, decimates, finds the chunk and runs
the samplers (`observe`). The event loop describes each kept frame as soon as
its context is complete, embeds the answer, appends it to
`observations.jsonl` and hands it to `on_unit`. Between them is a bounded
queue: when the model falls behind, the oldest waiting frame is dropped and
counted.

When the stream ends (or `stop_after_s`, `stop`, or `StopStream` from a
callback), the run is written out as `media.json`, `timeline.json`,
`manifest.json`, `descriptions.json` and `embedded.json`, in `offline`'s
shapes. A chunk's description there is its frames' answers joined in time
order; each answer is kept whole under `observations`.

There is no audio; `record=` keeps the stream for an `offline` run afterwards.
