"""Rebuild a frame store from a manifest and the video.

    video.recreate(manifest="d/manifest.json", video="shop.mp4", out="rebuilt",
                   verify="d/store")

A manifest names every frame a run kept by `index` (its position in a decode of
every frame) and records the source it came from. This decodes the video again,
writes those frames as the store did, and with `verify=` byte-compares them
against an existing store; a rebuilt store matches the original byte for byte.

Decodes with `av` and `cv2`, and imports nothing from the pipeline but the
error base: the manifest alone is enough. The file can be handed over with a
manifest and a video. Views a sampler made of its frames are its own code's
output, so they are counted, not rebuilt.
