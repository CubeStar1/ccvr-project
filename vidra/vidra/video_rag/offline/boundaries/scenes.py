"""Scene evidence: content scores over the picture, thresholded into cuts.

Frames are decoded straight to the detection size. A frame's score is
PySceneDetect's content value, computed with OpenCV: the mean absolute
difference from the previous scored frame in hue, saturation and value,
averaged over the three. A `stride` scores every Nth frame; the threshold
should rise with it. `cuts.json` keeps the per-frame
score series, which `rethreshold` reads without decoding; `detect` and
`rethreshold` both go through `cuts_from_scores`.
